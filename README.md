# Nand2Tetris

This repository documents my journey through the **Nand2Tetris course**, where I am learning the fundamentals of computer architecture from the ground up.

- Implemented all **combinational and sequential chips** in Nand2Tetrisâ€™ custom HDL.
- Currently **recreating the entire hardware suite in Verilog**, bridging the educational HDL with an industry-standard hardware description language.
- The goal is to deepen my understanding of how hardware design translates across different abstraction layers and toolchains.
